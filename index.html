					<p>My name is Maddie Reynolds, and I am nineteen years 					old. I attend the University of Georgia (<strong>go dawgs!</strong>) as 					a sophomore with a major in psychology. I hope to go to PA 					school, after graduating from UGA, to become a physician 					assistant. Currently, I am a certified nursing assistant to 					earn hours for PA school. I enjoy running, dancing, and 					having fun!
