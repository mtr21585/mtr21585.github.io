			<h3>My Family!</h3>
				<div>
					<p>I have a loving family of four consisting of my mom, my dad, my 				younger sister, and me. We also share our home with two furry puppies named Max and 				Sophie. My family and I love to stay active by going to the gym, going on hikes, and 				hanging out outdoors. My sister is my built-in best friend, as she is only two years 				younger than me. The four of us in my family are very close, and I couldn&#39t be 				more thankful for them!</p>
